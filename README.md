# Disease Prediction

This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms.

### Algorithms Explored

The following algorithms have been explored in code:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting

# Dataset

### Source

The dataset for this problem used with the `main.py` script is downloaded from here:

```
https://www.kaggle.com/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning
```

This dataset has 133 total columns, 132 of them being symptoms experienced by patiend and last column in prognosis for the same.

# Usage

Please make sure to install all dependencies before running the demo, using the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Interactive Demo

To train a model

```
python main.py
```

## Interactive Demo

For running an interactive demo or sharing it with others, please run `demo.py` using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

```
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```

## Standalone Demo

For running the inference on test set or on custom inputs, you can also use the `test.py` file as follows:

```
python test.py
```

**NOTE:** ***This project is for demo purposes only. For any symptoms/disease, please refer to a Doctor.***
